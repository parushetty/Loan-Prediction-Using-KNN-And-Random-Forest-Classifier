# Loan-Prediction-Using-KNN-And-Random-Forest-Classifier


Description:
            This project aims to develop a predictive model for a bank to assess the risk associated with loan applications using machine learning algorithms and implemented, compared the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest Classifier algorithms in predicting loan approval or rejection.
